# CornerGrocer

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. <br>
  Corner Grocer wanted a program to read a list of their sales and count occurences of each one to help them reorganize thier shelves. They also wanted a back up of the counts in a frequency.dat file. Further,
  they wanted to be able to search and display counts, as well as display the counts of all items in a numerical and histogram form. <br> <br>
What did you do particularly well? <br>
  I think I documented it well, choose descriptive variable and function names. I believe overall someone would find this highly readable.
<br><br>
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? <br>
  I'm not particularly happy with the valiation functions. I think I could make it more robust using a try/catch method and maybe putting them in the same function instead of splitting them out. 
  I would also like to update it so the user could specify the file to add and also update frequency.dat with the new values to have a rolling count of data.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? <br>

<br><br>
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? <br>

<br><br>
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? <br>
