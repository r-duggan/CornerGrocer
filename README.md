Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. <br>
  Corner Grocer wanted a program to read a list of their sales and count occurences of each one to help them reorganize thier shelves. They also wanted a back up of the counts in a frequency.dat file. Further,
  they wanted to be able to search and display counts, as well as display the counts of all items in a numerical and histogram form. <br> <br>
